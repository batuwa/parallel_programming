# Parallel Programming Code Snippets

This repo contains code from my [Parallel Programming](https://medium.com/craftdata-labs/parallel-programming-for-data-processing-part-ii-multiprocessing-and-multithreading-8ec8649e9dd1) blog series in medium.

The series starts from the fundamentals of parallel data processing in the processort level (SIMD, CUDA) right upto the higher level languages (C, Python, Go).

Only Part I and Part II have been finished so far.
